# Prompt Text
```

```

# Response Text
Generated a comprehensive task list for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application implementation based on the specification and plan documents. The tasks are organized into 8 phases: 1) Project Setup, 2) Foundational Components, 3) User Registration & Authentication, 4) Todo Management, 5) Data Persistence & User Isolation, 6) Responsive Web Interface, 7) Security & Performance, and 8) Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns. The task list includes 70 individual tasks with proper IDs, story labels where appropriate, and file paths. Each phase has clear goals and independent test criteria where applicable. Dependencies between phases are clearly defined, and parallel execution opportunities are identified.

# Outcome
Successfully created a detailed and structured task list that breaks down the implementation of the Todo Full-Stack Web Application into manageable, executable tasks. The tasks follow the required checklist format and are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.
